<h2>1.Walk/Ride a Bike</h2><br/><p>
     Sometimes, it’s not necessary to take a car everywhere you go; walking or riding a bike is a great way to get some exercise and reduce your carbon footprint.Every time you drive solo in an SUV, you’re adding more than 1.5 pounds of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases to the environment with each mile. Change your driving habits and you make an immediate impact on the environment. Take short trips on foot or by bike instead, and you’ll also make an immediate impact on your health. While riding your bike at a leisurely 6 miles per hour, you can burn 240 calories an hour or more. Walking at a normal pace of 2 to 3 miles per hour, you can burn up to 300 calories or more each hour.

2.Skip the Bottled Water
 </h2><br/><p>
 Opt for a reusable water bottle to save money and help the environment. Besides, tap water is already stringently monitored by the government, so bottled water isn’t necessarily safer.Because of recent reports of chemical contaminants in bottled water, many people are becoming concerned about drinking water from disposable plastic bottles, and especially about using plastic bottles to feed infants. Beyond the possible health concerns, buying bottled water is a “ridiculous use of plastic and an incredible waste of money,” says Trask. A better option: Buy an environmentally-friendly reusable stainless-steel canteen-like bottle for carrying your water around. For hot beverages, use a thermos so you won’t contribute to the “staggering” number of disposable coffee cups and lids that are thrown out each year, she says.

3.Grow Your Own Food
</h2><br/><p>
 Having your own garden is a great way to eat organically, avoid genetically modified foods, and reduce the need for polluting farming equipment and substandard irrigation methods.Planting and maintaining an organic vegetable garden in your yard provides countless benefits. You can enjoy a variety of veggies that are far fresher and taste better than anything you’ll find in the supermarket. You’ll be sustaining yourself with food that didn’t require fossil fuels for transportation. You’ll have the peace of mind of knowing that pesticides weren’t used on your vegetables. And you’ll get months of exercise as you prepare the ground, plant the seeds, tend to your crops, and pick the food yourself.
