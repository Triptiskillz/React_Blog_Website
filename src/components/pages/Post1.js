<p>Although the top 10 environmental issues that face the planet can be at best “subjective” we have attempted to aggregate and prioritise the list in order to put things into perspective.
   We have also accompanied each of the environmental issues with a video that explains the matter in depth. You can view the clip by pressing the play button on the image.

<p>It is very difficult to prioritise the top 10 environmental issues facing our planet today. One thing is for sure and that is over population is at the root of all of the issues.
If we do not act soon to start to curb human breeding patterns… We will almost certainly face an environmental meltdown.<br/>
What are your thoughts on the issues that face the planet and what do you think could be done to start undoing the damage created by humans?</p>
<br/><h2>1. Population:</h2><br/>
<p>Without a doubt the biggest issue facing the environment is over population of humans. All other major environmental issues flow from the very fact that we are over populating the planet.
<br/>
The worlds population has tripled in the last 60 years placing stress on every aspect of the environment. More land is developed every day to accommodate the urban spread.
<br/>
In 1950 the population stood at 2,555,982,611 compared to 2019 which it now stands at over 7,593,000,000.+ The actual maths is that the worlds population has increased by almost 3 times. That is staggering when you think about it. That figure is increasing even as we speak!
</p>
<br/><h2>2. Climate Change:</h2><br/>
<p>The most controversial and political of the top 10 environmental issues. Recently an overwhelming majority of climate scientists, believe that human activities are currently affecting the climate and that the tipping point has already been passed. In other words, it is too late to undo the damage that climate change has done to the environment.
<br/>
At this stage the best we can do is regulate the further impact upon the environment by developing more environmentally friendly methods of energy production by reducing the mining and burning of fossil fuels.
</p>
<br/><h2>3. Loss of Biodiversity:</h2><br/>
<p>The loss of biodiversity on the planet can be directly related to the behaviours of human beings. Humans have destroyed and continue to destroy the habitats of species on a daily basis.
<br/>
When we exterminate one species, it has a knock on effect in the food chain which in turn upsets the Eco-systems inter dependent on one another.
</p>
 <br/><h2>4. The Phosphorus and Nitrogen Cycles</h2><br/>
<p>Although the effect of human activities on the carbon cycle is better known, the lesser known effect on the cycle of Nitrogen actually has a greater impact on the environment.
<br/>
The human race’s use and abuse of nitrogen  has been one of the most beneficial technologies for our own species for decades. Every year, humans convert an estimated 120 million tons of nitrogen from the atmosphere into reactive forms such as nitrates, mainly in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizer for crops and in the use of food additives.
</p>
<br/><h2>5. Water:</h2><br/>
<p>Many experts believe that in the near future water will become a commodity just like Gold and Oil. Some experts say that wars will be fought over who owns the water supply.
<br/>
Currently, one third of humans have inadequate access to clean, fresh water. The number is expected to increase by to up to two thirds by 2050. That is that two thirds of the worlds population will not have access to clean water.
<br/>
Over population, demand and pollution from industry is to blame.
</p>
<br/><h2>6. Ocean Acidification:</h2><br/>
<p>A direct effect of excessive CO2 production. The oceans absorb as much as 25% of all human carbon dioxide emissions. The gas then combines with other elements to form compounds such as carbolic acid.
<br/>
Over the last 250 years, surface acidity of the ocean has increased by an estimated 30%. The acidity is expected to increase by 150% by 2100.
</p>
<br/><h2>7. Pollution</h2><br/>
<p>Pollution of air, water and soil by chemical compounds that take many years to breakdown. Most of these chemicals are the bi-products of our modern lifestyle and are created by industry and motor vehicle exhaust.
<br/>
Pollution isn’t just limited to the air. Soil is another place where pollution is starting to take hold.
<br/>
Common toxic substances include heavy metals, nitrates and plastic.
<br/>
A lot of the plastics that are discarded by humans end up the ocean. These plastics tend to go unseen by humans as the pollution is usually blown out to sea by prevailing winds.
<br/>
Read an article on Ocean Plastics.
</p>
<br/><h2>8. Ozone Layer Depletion:</h2><br/>
<p>Depletion of our ozone layer has been mainly attributed to the release of chemical pollution containing the chemicals Chlorine and Bromide. Once the chemicals  reach the upper atmosphere, they cause ozone molecules to break apart causing a hole to form, the largest of which is over the Antarctic.
<br/>
The atmosphere blocks many of the harmful UV rays from the sun that can damage living tissue. In an effort to reduce this process, CFCs have been banned in many manufacturing processes and products.
</p>
<br/><h2>9. Over Fishing:</h2><br/>
<p>It is estimated that by 2050 that there will be no fish left in the sea. I actually think that this is the single most devastating truth that I have discovered.
<br/>
The extinction of many fish species is due to humans over fishing the oceans to supply an ever increasing populations demand for sea food.
<br/>
The collapse of the Atlantic Cod Fishery is one such example of how humans have exploited the planet’s natural resources to the brink of extinction.
<br/>
</p>

<br/><h2>10. Deforestation:</h2><br/>
<p>Since 1990 half of the worlds rain forests have been destroyed. The clearing of forests continue at an alarming rate.
<br/>
To add to the worry a recent phenomenon has been added to the list.
<br/>
Trees are now dying globally at a rate never before seen.</p>
